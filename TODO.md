**PRIORITY**:
    use mousePos to flip cells
    make START, RESET, STOP buttons at bottom 
        use mouselistener locations to determine location
        


**MAYBE**:
    add grid to define square edges


**NOTES**
    gameloop does not need mouseListeners because it's only when the game is started
    deleted STATE; going to use VIEW for updating gui and storing on/off cells
    clicking START should start the gameLoop
